# Python Data Structures: Lists and Tuples
Python project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** at **ALX** to practice using lists and tuples.

| `1-element_at.py` | Retrieves an element from a list |
| `2-replace_in_list.py` | Replaces an element at a specific position in a list |
| `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` | Prints  all integers of  alist in reverse order |
| `4-new_in_list.py` | Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list |
| `5-no_c.py` | Removes all characters c and C from a string |

| `9-max_integer.py` | Finds the biggest integer of a list |
| `10-divisible_by_2.py` | Finds all multiples of 2 in a list and returns a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2 |
| `11-delete_at.py` | Deletes the item at a specific position in a list |
| `12-switch.py` | A completed source code in order to switch value of a and b |
